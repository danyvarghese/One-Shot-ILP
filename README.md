# One-Shot Hypothesis Derivation(OSHD)

It is a novel approach for one-shot rule learning  using a logic program
declarative bias which is a special case of Top-Directed
Hypothesis Derivation (TDHD)[1]

## Objective

We apply OSHD to the challenging task of Malayalam character recognition. This is a challenging task due to spherical
and complex structure of Malayalam hand-written language. We compare our results with a state-of-the-
art Deep Learning approach, called Siamese Network, which has been
developed for one-shot learning.
